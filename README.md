FEND Project 8 Neighborhood Map

READ FIRST PLEASE!!!

This is my incomplete take at the FEND Project 8.


////////

PROJECT INFORMATION

This project is a final project in Udacity's Google Developer Scholarship - Front End Web Development Nanodegree.
Goal is to have a map of my own or my favorite neighborhood showing various locations to enjoy, utilizing 3rd party APIs. I decided to stay "global" here and not focus on any type of location.
The project is supposed to be a responsive, accessible single page app.

INSTRUCTIONS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
To get the program running:

1) open the folder in your favorite terminal and run "npm install" to get all relevant modules.
2) Thereafter, run "npm start" to open the dev version of the project or run "npm build" to initialize the production version.
3) The app should open in your browser. alternatively you can navigate to "localhost:3000" on your browser to open the map.

USED APIs AND SOURCES

Google Maps API
Foursquare API
- for now until completion, both of these are using my credentials. Please act responsible using this app.

I wanted to use as little modules as possible because there are to many of them, some work good, some work worse, some work not at all the way I want (or require too much learning). After some search I came across a youtube playlist by [Yahya Elharony](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOB68PvvmWCGNn8UMTpcfQEiITzxEEA1) which actually showed me some good approach to get my idea done.
